## Version workout

### Example Project

![Product breakdown](FreePDM_CoD-Figures/BDD_Example.png)

Let's assume this is a (part of a )structure breakdown of a basic car. The system does have five sub-systems namely:

- Chassis (_SubSystem1_)
- Drivetrain (_SubSystem2_)
- Body (_SubSystem3_)
- Entertainment (_SubSystem4_)
- SafetySystem (_SubSystem5_)

The Engine is from an external supplier. The body of the car is breakdown further into multiple body work items.  
Below them there is the breakdown in single parts.  

### Mechanical project structure

![Project structure](FreePDM_CoD-Figures/PKG_MechProjects.png)

_Note: The circle with the plus in the diagram means that site with the symbol is owner of the other side. Simple example: The cassis is part of the car and so the car is owner of the chassis._  
I expect that most Mechanical engineers have a (project)tree in mind(as above). Probably because project managers work kind of that way(work structure breakdown) but also because it follows kind of the Assembly hierarchy as shown at the top.  
This in reverse is also how the authorisation is. The authorisation start at the bottom parts / assemblies / modules. Then it works up.
A simple example: the drivetrain can't be authorised when the engine isn't ready, and the engine can be authorised when the motor computer isn't finished.  

Another point is that every item in the model tree needs to be authorised to have a (revision )state. Also needs every item needs a revision number. During the project the revision number of items can diverge.

### svn Project structure

To get a system as svn working as a PDM system where every item have its own history, and his own data.

- db information
- part file / Assembly file (Optional drawing since it could be part of the part / assembly file)
- image (graphical representation inside the pdm system)

extra documentation

- Fem analysis file (Also Fem Analysis Document)
- specification from manufacturer(s)
- Calculation(s)
- Test documentation (optional analysis files)
- Other documents 

![Project structure](FreePDM_CoD-Figures/PKG_SVNProcects.png)

There are in this case two options for a divining access to a item / folder:

1. One *folder* with everything inside it
2. One folder for each number (see above). so that it is grouped

First option is easy every file the project is in a single folder.
Everybody that works on the project has read access to that folder.
Every item that needs a change has to go from read only to write access. From that moment on other users can't edit that item (but still open the item).  
In the second option (See the figure above) every number is its own svn project. 
Then can give read /write access to a single project it could speedup if a user block the whole folder for write access (even if it edits only a single file).
This takes probably(it is an assumption, yes) less overhead than giving write access to every individual file as it hast be done in the case with everything in a single folder.  
Finally it is possible work with a folder for every number AND read / write access for every file.

_Note: The more I write down about how I think it should work the more I doubt if I'm wrong.
Maybe a folder structure as it is mechanical workout too(compared to method 1). But somehow it feels more complex._

A addition based on the svn figure.
There is a arrow pointing from _new update_ to _ProjectCar_ what i meant is that when a new project started it can depend on a previous project. And in that way take over (a part of its )structure.

#### Access control

I add a few links to questions / information about svn related to permissions, read / write access, security and file locking.

- [setup access](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/81361/how-do-i-set-up-access-control-in-svn)
- [Read only user](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/282018/single-read-only-user-for-svn)
-  [Security settings](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1400708/svn-with-apache-security)

Extra info about [file locking](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/07/svn-lock-unlock-examples/) see also [discussion topic](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=594392&sid=9b31b19f572ae66342daab88ffe958d2#p594392)


### Works this too in git?

To answer the question directly. Not all will workout in plain git.  
Read only is possible but a bit more difficult as with svn. File-locking is not possible with plain git. With the git LFS it is possible and is specially helpful with (partly )binary files like FC files, docx files etc.
I added another topic that looks like a bit more an issue to git than svn and that is private git servers.

### _Update during development 2022-10-06_

The info above describe the project and the effect it have on the creation of a system.
A project can be there for the creation of a system.
But the creation of a system can exist out of multiple projects.  
When implementing projects what has to be added to regarding project management etc?
So the combination of those arguments made that the design of this system changes.
The project level will be **replaced** by a system level regarding file storing.
Of course there are points where systems are stacked above each other / are designed by another developer.
There should be thought how the CAD files could be retrieved and used later on!  
Projects are not removed completely because there is some need for ECN numbers, roles during the release process etc. **The main point is there is no dedicated project management tools inside it!**

#### File system

There are three file systems that should be supported. All depended on the preferred workflow.  
These are shown below.

<!--@Kunda1 thanks for pointing to mermaid-->
**Separated Folder for drawings:**

```mermaid
  graph TD;
    A{{File System}} --> B(System 1);
    A{{File System}} --> C(System 2);
    A{{File System}} --> D(System ...);
    A{{File System}} --> E(System N);
    C --> F(CAD Folder);
    C --> G(Drawing Folder);
    C --> H(Documents Folder);
    C --> I(Optional Other Folders);
    F --- J[CAD files 1 ... N];
    F --- J[CAD files 1 ... N];
    F -.- J[CAD files 1 ... N];
    F --- J[CAD files 1 ... N];
    G --- K[Drawing file 1 .. N];
    G --- K[Drawing file 1 .. N];
    G -.- K[Drawing file 1 .. N];
    G --- K[Drawing file 1 .. N];
    H --- L[Document 1 .. N];
    H --- L[Document 1 .. N];
    H -.- L[Document 1 .. N];
    H --- L[Document 1 .. N];
```

**Drawings Folder subfolder for CAD files:**

```mermaid
  graph TD;
    A{{File System}} --> B(System 1);
    A{{File System}} --> C(System 2);
    A{{File System}} --> D(System ...);
    A{{File System}} --> E(System N);
    C --> F(CAD Folder);
    C --> H(Documents Folder);
    C --> I(Optional Other Folders);
    F --> G(Drawing Folder);
    F --- J[CAD files 1 ... N];
    F --- J[CAD files 1 ... N];
    F -.- J[CAD files 1 ... N];
    F --- J[CAD files 1 ... N];
    G --- K[Drawing file 1 .. N];
    G --- K[Drawing file 1 .. N];
    G -.- K[Drawing file 1 .. N];
    G --- K[Drawing file 1 .. N];
    H --- L[Document 1 .. N];
    H --- L[Document 1 .. N];
    H -.- L[Document 1 .. N];
    H --- L[Document 1 .. N];
```

**Drawings added in CAD files folder:**

```mermaid
  graph TD;
    A{{File System}} --> B(System 1);
    A{{File System}} --> C(System 2);
    A{{File System}} --> D(System ...);
    A{{File System}} --> E(System N);
    C --> F(CAD Folder);
    C --> H(Documents Folder);
    C --> I(Optional Other Folders);
    F --- J[CAD files 1 ... N];
    F --- J[CAD files 1 ... N];
    F -.- J[CAD files 1 ... N];
    F --- J[CAD files 1 ... N];
    F --- K[Drawing file 1 .. N];
    F --- K[Drawing file 1 .. N];
    F -.- K[Drawing file 1 .. N];
    F --- K[Drawing file 1 .. N];
    H --- L[Document 1 .. N];
    H --- L[Document 1 .. N];
    H -.- L[Document 1 .. N];
    H --- L[Document 1 .. N];
```

More complex structures could also be possible.
It is important to think how it is possible to achieve this!  
An example:

```mermaid
  graph TD;
    A{{File System}} --> B(System 1);
    A{{File System}} --> C(System 2);
    A{{File System}} --> D(System ...);
    A{{File System}} --> E(System N);
    C --> F(Software Design);
    C --> G(Electrical Design);
    C --> H(Mechanical Design);
    C --> I(...);
    H --> J(Concepts);
    H --> K(Detailed Design);
    H --> L(Documentation);
    H --> M(...);
    J --- N[CAD - Concept 1 ... N];
    J --- N[CAD - Concept 1 ... N];
    J -.- N[CAD - Concept 1 ... N];
    J --- N[CAD - Concept 1 ... N];
    K --- O[CAD files 1 ... N];
    K --- O[CAD files 1 ... N];
    K -.- O[CAD files 1 ... N];
    K --- O[CAD files 1 ... N];
    K ----P(Drawings);
    K ----Q(FEM analysis);
    P --- R[Drawing file 1 .. N];
    P --- R[Drawing file 1 .. N];
    P -.- R[Drawing file 1 .. N];
    P --- R[Drawing file 1 .. N];
    L --- S[Document 1 .. N];
    L --- S[Document 1 .. N];
    L -.- S[Document 1 .. N];
    L --- S[Document 1 .. N];
```

## Requested Information

### General

1. [User Group](#user-group)
2. [Development Environment(s)](#development-environments)
3. [How to access files](#how-to-access-files)

### User Group

To define a user group there are some parameters how to define it:

- Budget of comparable tool
- expected company size
- Complexity

**expected company size** 
The (expected )company size probably small to medium sized companies. There are a few parameters how to divine it.

- Head count of staff([see Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium-sized_enterprises))

_old:(Small? to medium)Company size <#OfUsers --> Does that matter? It depends probably on the hw and sw._
<!-- Yes that matters the size of the company say also something about the quality / complexity of it's hardware and software -->

### Development Environment(s)

What are the available environments that are available and what are the critical factors.

- Server
- Raspberry Pi
- Virtual Machine
- Local 

#### Server

#### Raspberry Pi
Raspberry Pi is a small size computer ideal for in a network environment but is it powerful enough?
Critical factors:

- Data through put(?)


#### Virtual Machine
Two categories of Virtual machines.

1. (example: Virtual Box)
2. (example: )

The type of virtualisation 

Critical factors: 


#### Local working
Ideal for a single user. 
Critical factors: 

- Difficult to set-up for multi user environment

### How to access files

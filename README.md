# FreePDM
A PDM for FreeCAD

This is going to be my first attempt to make a PDM. And it is going to be in Python.

Yeah. It's a bit scary.

The initial idea is to make a Skeleton (model), GUI, a MVC and an Admin module. The GUI is based on pySide. I need to make a WB.

Looking at previous attempts to make a PDM:
* https://github.com/cadracks-project/openplm (but FreePDM is going to be a "poor man's" PDM. You can compare it with SolidWorks PDM. Nothing fancy. That all brokes down sooner or later)
* https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=63794

Also interesting:

* The fcinfo macro for measure weight of a model

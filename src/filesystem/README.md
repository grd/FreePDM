A PDM for FreeCAD

# The Filesystem page

The Filesystem is a major part of FreePDM. It is primarily a storage of files that are immutable. The primary goals are to import / export files, moving files, the revision of files, renaming of files, and all with access control. To make this happening you want to check-in and check-out of files, so that others know that you checked out a file and can't check-out the file without notifying you. The filesystem use directories, just like ordinary directories, to organize the files. For access control an admin account needs to be used. He or she needs extra privileges, for instance when someone left and that guy checked out a file, then the admin needs to be able to fix that. The admin also sets the rules for the (automatic) renaming of files for instance and the things thet need to be make when someone changed a revision, such as to automatically generate a PDF for a drawing or generate STEP/STL files.

## The Filesystem class
TheFilesystem class contains all the things that are needed to manipulate files inside the PDM.

## Import / Export of files
`Filesystem.import` allows to import a file or files inside the PDM. When you import a file the meta-data also gets imported. The local files remain untouched.

`Filesystem.export` allows to export a file of files to a certain directory.

## Revision of files

## Check-in / Check-out

## Renaming of files

## Moving files

## Access control



## Todo:
- [ ] Add a filesystem (directories)
- [ ] Allow importing and exporting of files
- [ ] Hashing of files
- [ ] Partnumbering (both inside the Filesystem and in local files itself). This also means renaming of files and where used. The "where used" functionality can only be used inside the PDM because FreeCAD doesn't have such a feature.
- [ ] Dealing with other info (such as LidbreOffice files and other media)
- [ ] Replacing files in assemblies. Both into the Filesystem and the local files. This also relies on renaming of files.
- [ ] Copying files (incl. it's dependencies. Everything below and drawings, all optional). When it's not put into the Filesystem.
- [ ] Dealing with versions and releases.
- [ ] Disable released files with a disable state.
- [ ] Dealing with states
- [ ] Dealing with checkin and checkout. (the Filesystem should be read-only)
- [ ] Importing and exporting files.
- [ ] Dealing with projects (creating, modifying, closing, re-opening).
- [ ] Dealing with users. Who did what?

# FreePDM
A PDM for FreeCAD

The GUI is going to have multiple views in which you can view and modify attributes.

And this is also going to have multiple roles.

There is also going to be an admin page (or pages)

Todo:
- [ ] Show a list of files
- [ ] Dealing with projects (creating, modifying, closing, re-opening)
- [ ] Add a search button
- [ ] Add all the things done in the [skeleton](../skeleton/README.md)
- [ ] Partnumbering (both inside the Filesystem and in local files itself). This also means renaming of files and where used. The "where used" functionality can only be used inside the PDM because FreeCAD doesn't have such a feature.
- [ ] Dealing with other info (such as LibreOffice files and other media)
- [ ] Replacing files in assemblies. Both into the Filesystem and the local files. This also relies on renaming of files.
